# User Dashboard

## Backend
I have implementes simple CRUD operations for user management.

I have used Node.js as javascript runtime environment, Express.js as the backend framework and MongoDB as the database.

- Available API endpoints:
    1. ``` GET /api/users?page={page}&search={search} - Get all users with pagination and search ```

    2. ``` POST /api/users - Create a new user ```

    3. ``` PUT /api/users/:id - Update user details ```

    4. ``` DELETE /api/users/:id - Delete a user ```

### Local Setup
1. Clone the repository 
2. Run ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies
3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```
    mongoURI=<your_mongo_uri>
4. Run ```node index.js``` to start the server


## Frontend
The frontend is built using Next.js(React.js) and Tailwind CSS. I have utilised NextUI for the UI components. 

<strong>The frontend is a simple user dashboard where you can view, add, update and delete users. One can click on the columns to sort the users based on the column, can search for a user.</strong>

#### Local Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Run ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies
3. Run ```npm start``` to start the server
